Pseudo Code:

1. What is pseudo code?
It is an understandable way of writing the algorithm in a number of steps so that user in this case can understand the logic of the problem or algorithm before write it in a programmable code. 

2. Why and when we use it?
we use pseudo code because it is easier way to help user how to write the algorithm of the problem and can understand it in a good way.
we can use the algorithm in : problem solving , team communication, documentation, and others.

3.How to write pseudo code to represent algorithm?
there are a number of steps to write correct algorithm :
a. define the aim of the problem.
b. list input and output of the problem.
c. use control structure such as: FOR, WHILE , IF loop in order to facilitate the problem.
D. be sure that steps write clearly.

5. Example on problem algorithm written in pesudo code?
algorithm for show if grade is pass or fail :
1. input: grade=X
2. do for loop:
if X>=50% 
if yes --print  result="PASS"
if no --print  result= "Fail"
end if
end for loop
return result
